- 👋 Hello!! My name is Dhiego! I'm 35 years old and had a few programming topics during the university but never worked with it.
- 👀 I love the area and programming topics and I am always checking new trends and learning programs.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Javascript as in the pass, back on my 20's, I was designing HTML and loved the results. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on small projects for begginers in order to increase my knowledge.
- 📫 You can reach me sending an email!

Let's code and learning!! :D
